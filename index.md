## Overview

Undergraduate Student-Athlete and Bioinformatics Researcher @ Princeton University 

### Research Scope

My research is in the field of bioinformatics, where I am concerned with finding patterns within genetic data â€“ with work spanning from evolutionary genomics to somatic mutation research. I couple quantitative genetics with functional genomics, computational tools, and neural networks.

### Skills

Evolutionary Genetics, Somatic Cell Genetics, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Bioinformatics, Python, R, Java.

## Education
