## Overview

Undergraduate Student-Athlete and Bioinformatics Researher @ Princeton University 

### Research Scope

My research is in the field of bioinformatics, where I am concerned with finding patterns within genetic data â€“ with work spanning from evolutionary genomics to somatic mutation research. I couple quantitative genetics with functional genomics, computational tools, and neural networks.

### Skills

Evolutionary Genetics, Somatic Cell Genetics, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Bioinformatics, Python, R, Java.

## Education

`2022 - present`
__Princeton University, Princeton, NJ__

- Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Quantitative and Computational Biology, Computer Science
- Commit 25+ hours weekly to practices, meetings, film analysis, and workouts, games as a member of Varsity Football Team
- 3.5 GPA

## Research Experience

`Joshua Akey Lab`
__Princeton Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics__

- Conducted research into archaic human DNA SNP distribution across human genome from Neandertal and Denisovan genomic data
- Explored implications of Ka/Ks values for somatic mutation data
- Developed simulation techniques for Ka/Ks tests involving magnitudes of natural selection
- Experimented using deep neural networks to contrive patterns involving high-risk sites for cancer mutations
